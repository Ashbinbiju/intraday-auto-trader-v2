Conditional Trigger
The Conditional Trigger API is a special set of APIs which lets you place order on the basis of set conditions. These conditions can be based on price or technical indicators or a combination of both. You can set one or multiple orders to be triggered when the condition is met.

When the conditional order is triggered, you will receive a postback update if set up here.

POST	/alerts/orders	Place Conditional Trigger
PUT	/alerts/orders/{alertId}	Modify Conditional Trigger
DELETE	/alerts/orders/{alertId}	Delete Conditional Trigger
GET	/alerts/orders/{alertId}	Get Conditional Trigger by ID
GET	/alerts/orders	Get All Conditional Triggers
Note

Conditional Triggers are currently supported only for Equities and Indices.
You can receive a postback update by providing a Webhook URL (here) while generating the Access Token.
Place Conditional Trigger
Using this API, you can create a new conditional trigger wherein you define conditions (price or technical indicators) that, when met, place one or multiple orders automatically on the user's Dhan account. It supports multiple combinations of indicators and operators.

Live Market Feed
Real-time Market Data across exchanges and segments can now be availed on your system via WebSocket. WebSocket provides an efficient means to receive live market data. WebSocket keeps a persistent connection open, allowing the server to push real-time data to your systems.

All Dhan platforms work on these same market feed WebSocket connections that deliver lightning fast market data to you. Do note that this is tick-by-tick event based data that is sent over the websocket.

You can establish upto five WebSocket connections per user with 5000 instruments on each connection.
All request messages over WebSocket are in JSON whereas all response messages over WebSocket are in Binary. You will require WebSocket library in any programming language to be able to use Live Market Feed along with Binary converter.

Using DhanHQ Libraries for WebSockets
Establishing Connection
To establish connection with DhanHQ WebSocket for Market Feed, you can to the below endpoint using WebSocket library.



wss://api-feed.dhan.co?version=2&token=eyxxxxx&clientId=100xxxxxxx&authType=2

Query Parameters

Field	Description
version
required	2 for DhanHQ v2
token
required	Access Token generated via Dhan
clientId
required	User specific identification generated by Dhan
authType
required	2 by Default
Adding Instruments
You can subscribe upto 5000 instruments in a single connection and receive market data packets. For subscribing, this can be done using JSON message which needs to be send over WebSocket connection.

Note

You can only send upto 100 instruments in a single JSON message. You can send multiple messages over a single connection to subscribe to all instruments and receive data.

Request Structure


{
    "RequestCode" : 15,
    "InstrumentCount" : 2,
    "InstrumentList" : [
        {
            "ExchangeSegment" : "NSE_EQ",
            "SecurityId" : "1333"
        },
        {
            "ExchangeSegment" : "BSE_EQ",
            "SecurityId" : "532540"
        }
    ]
}

Parameters

Field	Type	Description
RequestCode
required	int	Code for subscribing to particular data mode.
Refer to feed request code to subscribe to required data mode
InstrumentCount
required	int	No. of instruments to subscribe from this request
InstrumentList.ExchangeSegment
required	enum string	Exchange Segment of instrument to be subscribed as found in Annexure
InstrumentList.SecurityId
required	string	Exchange standard ID for each scrip. Refer here
Keeping Connection Alive
To keep the WebSocket connection alive and prevent it from closing, the server side uses Ping-Pong module. Server side sends ping every 10 seconds to the client server (in this case, your system) to maintain WebSocket status as open.

An automated pong is sent by websocket library. You can use the same as response to the ping.

In case the client server does not respond for more than 40 seconds, the connection is closed from server side and you will have to reestablish connection.
Market Data
The market feed data is sent as structured binary packet which is shared at super fast speed.

DhanHQ Live Market Feed is real-time data and there are three modes in which you can receive the data, depending on your use case:

Ticker Data
Quote Data
Full Data
Subscribing Instruments

Binary Response
Binary messages consist of sequences of bytes that represent the data. This contrasts with text messages, which use character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to represent data in a readable format. Binary messages require parsing to extract the relevant information.

The reason for us to choose binary messages over text or JSON is to have compactness, speed and flexibility on data to be shared at lightning fast speed.

All responses from Dhan Market Feed consists of Response Header and Payload. Header for every response message remains the same with different feed response code, while the payload can be different.

Endianness
Endianness determines the order in which bytes are arranged for multi-byte data (like integers and floats).

Types:
- Little Endian: Least significant byte first (0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12)
- Big Endian: Most significant byte first (0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78)

The data on DhanHQ Websockets are sent in Little Endian. In case your system is Big Endian, you will have to define endianness while reading the websocket.

Note


Whenever 20 or 200 level depth packets are sent on the connection, they are stacked one after another in a single message. For 20 level depth, if two instruments are subscribed, then the first instrument's Bid packet followed by Ask packet of that instrument is added and then the second instrument's bid and ask packets in same sequence. To handle this, you can break down the packet on the basis of length.

Feed Disconnect
If you want to disconnect WebSocket, you can send below JSON request message via the connection.


{
    "RequestCode" : 12
}
In case of WebSocket disconnection from server side, you will receive disconnection packet, which will have disconnection reason code.

Expired Options Data
This API gives you expired options contract data. We have pre processed data for you to get it on rolling basis i.e. you can fetch last 5 years of strike wise data based on ATM and upto 10 strikes above and below. In addition to that, the data values are open, high, low, close, implied volatility, volume, open interest and spot information as well.

Historical Rolling Data
Fetch expired options data on a rolling basis, along with the Open Interest, Implied Volatility, OHLC, Volume as well as information about the spot. You can fetch for upto 30 days of data in a single API call. Expired options data is stored on a minute level, based on strike price relative to spot (example ATM, ATM+1, ATM-1, etc.).
