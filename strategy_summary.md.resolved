# 🦅 Sentinel v2.0 Strategy Note

## 1. Core Philosophy
**"Trade Strong Stocks in the Direction of the Market."**
We identify the market regime (Bullish/Choppy) first, then scan top-performing sectors for stocks showing momentum breakouts.

---

## 2. Market Sentinel (Phase 1)
Before looking at any stock, we check the **Market Context** using NIFTY 50 and BANKNIFTY data (via `brkpoint.in`).

**Logic: Position in Daily Range**
$$ \text{Position} = \frac{\text{LTP} - \text{Day Low}}{\text{Day High} - \text{Day Low}} $$

| Scenario | Condition | Resulting Mode | Extension Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BULLISH** ✅ | Both Indices in Top 45% (`Pos > 0.55`) | **TREND MODE** | **3.0%** (Aggressive) |
| **WEAK** ⚠️ | Any Index in Bottom 55% (`Pos <= 0.55`) | **SAFETY MODE** | **1.5%** (Conservative) |
| **DATA FAIL** ❌ | Internet/API Down | **SAFETY MODE** | **1.5%** (Fail-Safe) |

*   **Impact:** In Safety Mode, we reject stocks that have already moved >1.5%, assuming the move is exhausted. In Trend Mode, we chase them up to 3.0%.

---

## 3. Stock Selection (Phase 2)
1.  **Sector Filter:** We scan stocks from the **Top 4 Performing Sectors** only.
2.  **Breadth Check:** Stocks must be outperforming (Ranked by % Change).

---

## 4. Entry Criteria (The Checklist)
A stock must pass **ALL** of the following checks on the **5-Minute Candle**:

### A. Trend Indicators 📈
1.  **EMA Crossover:** `EMA(9)` must be ABOVE `EMA(20)`.
2.  **Price Strength:** `Close` > `EMA(9)` AND `Close` > `VWAP`.
3.  **Momentum:** `RSI(14)` > **55** (Rising Strength).

### B. Candle Pattern 🕯️
1.  **Color:** Must be a **GREEN** candle (Close > Open).
2.  **Heikin-Ashi:** Must be **Green** (Trend Continuation).
3.  **Volume:** Current Volume > `SMA(20, Volume)` (Volume Breakout).

### C. The "Guards" (Filters) 🛡️
1.  **Extension Guard:**
    *   Formula: [(Close - EMA20) / EMA20](file:///C:/Users/Ashbin/.gemini/antigravity/brain/2df2ed12-f98d-4c89-bf98-dea5fc2acbc3/config.py#67-74)
    *   Must be **LESS than** the Extension Limit (1.5% or 3.0% defined by Sentinel).
2.  **Late Entry Guard:**
    *   Verifies we are catching the *start* of the move, not the end.

---

## 5. Exit Rules (Money Management)
Once in a trade, we manage it automatically:

*   **Stop Loss (SL):** Fixed at **0.8%** initially.
*   **Target 1:** **0.6%** (Move SL to Breakeven).
*   **Target 2:** **1.2%** (Trail SL Aggressively).
*   **Target 3:** **2.0%** (Runners).

---

## 6. Execution Protocol
*   **Order Type:** MARKET Orders (Priority on getting IN).
*   **Frequency:** Continuous scanning every loop.
*   **Max Trades:** Controlled by available capital/limits.
