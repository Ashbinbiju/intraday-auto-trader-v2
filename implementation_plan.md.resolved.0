# Implementation Plan - IntradayScreener Bot

## Goal
Build an automated trading system that scrapes sector performance data from `intradayscreener.com`, identifies positive sectors, and trades stocks within those sectors based on VWAP and EMA 20 indicators.

## User Review Required
- **Authentication**: The site requires login. I will need to determine if I can use a static token/cookie or if I need to automate the login process. The USER mentioned "open in my opened background chrome", which suggests I might need to guide them to extract a token or use a browser automation tool that they can supervise (though I run on a server/headless locally).
- **Broker Integration**: I am assuming Angel One (SmartAPI) based on conversation history. Please confirm.
- **Data Source for Indicators**: Will we calculate VWAP/EMA 20 using the scraper's data (if available) or fetch live ticks from the broker? (Likely broker for accuracy).

## Proposed Changes

### Research & Scraping
- Analyze `intradayscreener.com` to find the JSON API endpoints used by the frontend.
- Create `scraper.py` to fetch:
    1. Sector Performance (find top gaining sectors).
    2. Stocks inside those sectors.

### Trading Logic (`logic.py`)
- **Input**: List of stocks from Scraper.
- **Process**:
    - Connect to SmartAPI (Angel One).
    - For each stock, fetch 1-minute (or 5-minute?) candle data.
    - Calculate VWAP and EMA 20.
    - Check condition: `Price > VWAP` and `Price > EMA 20` (and `Price > EMA 20` logic as checking strict trend).
    - **Signal**: BUY if conditions met.

### Execution Engine (`main.py`)
- Loop:
    1. Scrape Sectors.
    2. Filter Stocks.
    3. Run Logic.
    4. Place Order (Mock or Real).
    5. Sleep (INTERVAL).

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Run the scraper and verify it returns correct sectors matching the website.
- Run the logic on a few symbols and verify calculations against TradingView/Chart.
